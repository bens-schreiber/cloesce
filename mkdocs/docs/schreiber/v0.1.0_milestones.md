# v0.1.0 (MVP) Milestones

## v0.0.1

### Milestone

Capability to take a basic TypeScript model and convert it to a Sqlite database schema, TypeScript Workers backend, Client API and Wrangler setup. Determine initial project scaffold.

#### Schema Extractor

- Initial CIDL format
- Explicitly annotated Primary Keys
- CLI

#### D1

- Sqlite table generation
- Primary keys
- null, real, integer, blob, text

#### Workers

- Instantiated Model Methods
- Static Model Methods
- Explicit HTTP Response return type

#### Client API

- Instantiated and static Model method calling
- Serialize HTTP Response type
- Result monad

## v0.0.2

### Milestone

Expand on the types a Workers method can return, adding arrays and models. Introduce explicitly decorated Model foreign keys.

#### Schema Extractor

- Model return types
- Array return types
- Explicit Foreign keys (no navigation properties)

#### D1

- Foreign Keys

#### Workers

- Api endpoints can return models, arrays

#### Client API

- Serialize models, arrays

## v0.0.3

### Milestone

Add automatic CRUD generation (being: list, get, post, patch, delete). Add "Plain Old \<Language\> Objects" support, allowing developers to return any type that can be easily serialized on the frontend. Introduce a "Wrangler Environment" dependency, allowing developers to put secrets and keys into the Wrangler file and easily access them.

Accept default constructor values for CRUD generation

#### Schema Extractor

- CRUD decorators
- Pojo return types
- Wrangler environment variables

#### D1

- Staging environments (wrangler)

#### Workers

- CRUD generated endpoints
- Wrangler environment injection
- Pojo return types

#### Client API

- CRUD generated model methods
- Serialize pojo return types

## v0.0.4

### Milestone

Basic role based authentication, supporting Cloudflare Access and custom solutions (primarily focused on OAuth) via JWT. Cloesce will ship with a default `CloesceUser` with a

## v0.0.5

### Milestone

Introduce Durable Object dependencies, which act as singleton injectable instances for a Models methods. Classes annotate with `@DO` will assume all attributes are to be serialized and saved to Cloudflare KV. Methods on a DO are either internal or external, with internal only being called by a model, and external having a generated client API. Workers will call a Durable Object through a generated API, identical to the class

#### Schema Extractor

- Durable Object class, attribute, methods

#### Workers

- Generated API for Durable Objects

#### Client API

- Generated API for external routed Durable Object methods

## v0.0.6

### Milestone

Add R2 support, allowing a model to define an R2 bucket and link to it's R2 ID. Support CRUD generation for R2.
