# Contributing

Before spending any effort on a change, discuss the idea with the repository authors via email or Discord.

When contributing a significant feature or refactor, please first create a pull request with a detailed proposal in the `proposals/` directory.  A basic template for proposals can be found in `proposals/template.md`. Name the proposal `proposal-0.md`, and a proper version will be added after the pull request is merged.

When contributing a smaller change, such as a bug fix or documentation update, create a pull request directly against the `main` branch with a clear description of the change and its motivation.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Increase the version numbers in the header of `CHANGELOG.md` for the next release, and add an entry describing your change. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Tests

It is expected to write tests for any new features or bug fixes. Cloesce has a range of testing suites, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Please ensure that your changes are covered by appropriate tests to maintain the quality and reliability of the codebase.
