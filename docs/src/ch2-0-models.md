# Models

Models are used to define not only the structure of your data (and relationships between data), but also the operations that can be performed on that data, the storage mechanisms used, and the API endpoints exposed to interact with the data. A single Cloesce Model encapsulates an entity that exists across the stack.

Surprisingly, they're pretty simple! In this chapter, we will explore the various features of Cloesce Models, including defining D1, KV and R2 backed properties, relationships between Models, generated CRUD methods, and custom methods.
