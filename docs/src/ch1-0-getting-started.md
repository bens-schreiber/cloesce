# Getting Started

> [!TIP]
> Cloesce runs entirely on Cloudflare Workers, so familiarity with Workers and Wrangler is recommended. If you are new to Workers, check out the [Cloudflare Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

Welcome to the Getting Started guide. This document will help you set up a basic Cloesce project using the `create-cloesce` template. This guide covers:
- Installing Cloesce
- A basic project structure
- Building, running, and deploying your Cloesce application
