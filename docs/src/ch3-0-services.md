# Services

In the previous chapter, we discussed the capabilities of Cloesce Models and how they can be used to define infrastructure, data, backend APIs and the client API. In this chapter, we will discuss a seperate concept in Cloesce called "Services", namespaces that allow you to move significant business logic out of your Model definitions and into reusable components.

We will also discuss how Cloesce uses dependency injection to share Services and other resources across your application.
